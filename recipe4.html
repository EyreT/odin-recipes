        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p><i>For the Spider Pizzas:</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 box (7 ounces) frozen mini pizza bagels</li>
                <li>1 can (6 ounces) pitted black olives, drained</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The little spider pizzas are probably my favorite snack on this Halloween food ideas board! 
            It's as simple as grabbing a box of frozen mini pizza bagels and a can of pitted black olives.
            Cook the pizzas according to the directions on their box.<br><br>
            While they are baking, use a sharp paring knife to cut the olives
            into “spider” parts. One olive cut in half can work as the two halves of the spider's torso for one pizza.
            And then you can thinly slice a second halved olive to make the spider's legs for that pizza.
            Arrange the olives on top of the pizzas when the pizzas come out of the oven. <br><br>
            They don't have to be perfect to still be delicious Halloween snacks. Any extra olives left over after you make your Halloween party
            food can be used to make Greek rice, subbing the Kalamata olives for your extra black olives, another time.</p>
