        <h2>About these easy Halloween food ideas:</h2>
            <p>or any and all unique charcuterie board ideas, it's usually smart to have a theme<br>
            that ties everything together, like the brunch theme of my European breakfast board<br>
            or the flavor pairings of my wine and cheese board. Randomly, the ingredient tying<br>
            this Halloween party food platter together is mango!<br><br>
            One of the most popular fruits in the world, mangos are available year-round, making them great<br>
            for everyday meals, mango lemonade, and holidays. And they're orange,<br>
            making them perfect for Halloween snack ideas!<br>
            <br>
            So, for this Halloween food ideas platter, here's what we have:</p>

        <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;"><i>Which Halloween snacks can be made in advance?</i></h3>
            <p>If you're attending a Halloween party at somebody else's house rather than hosting,<br>
            most of these Halloween snacks can be carefully packed up and taken with you (so can Halloween dirt cups)!<br>
            The bat tortilla chips and mango salsa are, of course, a no brainer Halloween themed food to pack up and take.<br>
            The pumpkin deviled eggs and apple monsters also travel just fine if you pack them carefully.<br><br>
            The jalapeño popper mummies are still really good at room temperature bake them and cool them just before leaving,<br>
            and then pack them up. Make sure the mummies are fully cool before you put them in any sort of airtight container,<br>
            otherwise they'll steam and the crescent roll dough will get soggy.<br><br>
            However, the spider pizza bagels are really best when fresh. If you're traveling with these,<br>
            I would recommend cutting the olives into “spider parts” and taking them with you.<br>
            Then, when you get to your host's house, bake the pizza bagels and then assemble the spiders on top and serve them right away.</p>
