        <h2>About these easy Halloween food ideas:</h2>
            <p>Or any and all unique charcuterie board ideas, it's usually smart to have a theme that ties everything together, like the brunch theme of my European
            breakfast board. You might not know this, but I'm kind of internet famous for my Halloween food ideas and Halloween charcuterie board.<br><br>
            Mind you, internet famous... is not at all the same as regular famous, and that's fine with me. But if you do a search for “Halloween snacks” or “Halloween food”
            it's very likely that one of my posts will turn up near the top.
            I'm proud of that, because I put a lot of work into that platter of Halloween snacks (and also my Halloween bark and Halloween cake pops)!
            My favorite item on that board was probably the cute little pumpkin deviled eggs.<br><br>
            Today, I'm back with those again along with three more Halloween deviled egg recipes.</p><br>


        <h2>How to make deviled eggs for Halloween:</h2>
            <p>Start with your favorite deviled egg recipe or use the classic one in the recipe box below. You'll make the filling exactly like a normal deviled egg,
            but you'll just be adding food coloring at the end. Just like for Halloween dirt cups, I like to use GEL food coloring as the color is more intense,
            it doesn't add as much wetness to the filling. Besides, the gel is practically the only kind of food coloring I see at the store these days.<br><br>
            Does regular food coloring even exist still...??</p><br>
            

        <h2>Halloween deviled eggs with spiders?<br>
            Or eyeball deviled eggs for Halloween? Or both?</h2>
            <p>You'll need olives for several of these decorated eggs. Sliced green olives stuffed with pimentos make great eyeball deviled eggs. 
            Carefully using a paring knife, it's easy to cut whole, pitted black olives into the shape of spiders.<br>
            Use curly parsley or a small piece of chive to create a “stem” for your pumpkin deviled eggs.<br><br>
            And the neon green filling topped with black sesame seeds? <br><br>
            Well, I don't really know what those are. Generally spooky? Insect eggs? Bugs? I don't know! They're just for fun.</p><br>
        
        <h2>How long can you safely keep deviled eggs?</h2>
            <p>once the deviled eggs are prepared, they can be kept in the refrigerator up to three days. <b>Make sure! you cover them tightly with plastic wrap!.</b><br><br>
            I recently made the mistake of not covering my eggs, and let's just say, they got very dried out, and it was a trick, not a treat.
            While they <b>can</b> be refrigerated up to three days, I really think it's best to eat these deviled eggs soon after they're prepared.
            Especially because the food coloring can weep into the white of the egg. I suggest eating them the same day they're made, 
            or refrigerating them for just one night, for best flavor and appearance.</p><br>
